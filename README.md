# text-cnn-tf-keras
Another version of https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf. We hybrid keras with tensorflow, the implementation is more concise and the code is easier to read. 

The loss is smaller and the accuracy is higher when compared with that in https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf.
